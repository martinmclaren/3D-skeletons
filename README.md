# 3D Skeletons

_N.B. Project is currently in development, and code will be open-sourced in the future._

Geometry processing on 3D point clouds for medial axis estimation.

### Features
* Full GUI for loading and viewing point cloud vertices and normals (supported file-types: XYZ, OBJ, ...)
* Medial axis point estimation using maximal shrinking-ball algorithm (Ma, Bae, Choi, 2012)
* Medial axis topology estimation using spheremesh decomposition
